      <p>Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Leah Ryu. I'm a Korean American and a rising junior at Dartmouth College majoring 
          in Computer Science and Studio Art. I'm interested in a lot of things--illustration/painting, string instruments, fencing, video games, 
          books (especially cyberpunk), CTF, and more. Ask me about composers, colors, or poetry, games, or art history, 
          or my history with art, my relationship with coding, my relationship with the world, my summer in Italy...
      </p>
      <p>My work has been featured in Dartmouth's magazine of art and letters, the Stonefence Review: 
      <a href="https://www.stonefencereviewmag.com/spring-2019-art/2019/5/23/art-by-leah-ryu">See it here</a></p>
      <p>While my past work has mostly explored art and computer science in their own, respective senses, I've begun to 
          wonder what implications the deep emotionality &amp; humanity of the fine arts and the logical power &amp; structured
          of CS have for one another. In the same way that words and images sustain me, how does the conceptual world give to 
          computing? Can one write about, read about, and purport to support broader values of equality and justice if those
          aren't reflected in the technology they use, design, and dream of? Conversely, how can computation help us 
          understand the archetypal patterns, both physical and not, in all kinds of art? Can the dizzying ecstasy of
          organic emotion be evoked by simulations of these patterns? Do androids dream of electric sheep? These are the 
          mutually symbiotic questions that I hope will inform my future work and that of artists and engineers everywhere, 
          even if my art isn't always digital and my code isn't always artful.
