      <h1>Leah Ryu</h1>
      <p>Hi! Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Leah and I'm a rising junior at Dartmouth College majoring in Computer Science 
          and Studio Art. I'm interested in a lot of things--illustration/painting, string instruments, fencing, video games, 
          books, CTF, and more. Ask me about composers, or art history, or my history with art, my relationship with coding, 
          my relationship with the world, my summer in Italy...
      </p>
